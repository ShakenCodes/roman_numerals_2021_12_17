Learning exercise, writing a code kata to convert numbers to roman numerals.
Find a detailed description of the kata at: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/

The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)
Part I

The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     3 --> III
     4 --> IV
     5 --> V
     6 --> VI
     7 --> VII
     8 --> VIII
     9 --> IX
     10 --> X
     30 --> XXX
     40 --> XL
     50 --> L
     100 --> C
     300 --> CCC
     400 --> CD
     500 --> D
     900 --> CM
     1000 --> M
     1300 --> MCCC
     1500 --> MD
     1832 --> MDCCCXXXII
    etc.

For a full description of how it works, take a look at [this useful reference website](http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html).

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher.)
